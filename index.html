		<p><a href = "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">Call of Duty</a> has been the one single game I've played since I was 12 years old. The main reason why It totally caugth me was because it's a rather competitive game. Not only do I enjoy playing it with my friends but also alone, because it has the league mode modality.</p>

		<p>I'd recommend everybody play this great game. The more you play it, the more you get addicted to it (in the good way).</p>
		<hr>
		<p>The <i>game modes</i> I enjoy playing the most are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Domination</li>
			<li>Hardpoint</li>
			<li>Team Deathmatch</li>
			
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<p>Call of Duty besides having multiplayer, also has this thing called <strong>zombies mode</strong> which people like a lot (personally I don't). This is a great alternative for whenever you get bored of playing regular multiplayer matches.</p>
